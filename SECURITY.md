## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a package vulnerability, create an Issue for it using the regular method. Also report in the Slack `dev`
channel what you have found. You can expect feedback within a day, but fixing a vulnerability found in a recent version of a
dependency may not be possible for a few days. We are doing our best to keep the project vulnerability free.
